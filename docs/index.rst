The hot end is really hot. Don't touch it.

# Overview

The overall goal of 3D printing at CCHS is to provide ease of use and reliability. It is notoriously difficult to keep printers in a shared environment functioning consistently. To tackle that we're attempting to set up printers with known good formulas, and to then document best practices for each printer. Hopefully, by sticking to the lit path you'll achieve successful prints without damaging the machines. Stray from the path and fiery doom awaits.

# OctoPrint

Most 3D printers at CCHS is accessible via an OctoPrint server. To print to them you will first need to install the Cura slicer on your laptop and connect it to a 3D printer via OctoPrint. Follow the link below and we'll walk you through that setup process.

# Issues

You are encouraged to make liberal use of the [Issues tab](https://github.com/CCHS-Melbourne/3DPrinters/issues) to report any problems you may encounter. Format your issue titles with the printer name first if relevant. Issues may include mismatches between documentation and reality - please let us know so we can improve. If you're at the space and not sure what to do, have a look at the existing issues and see if there's something you can help with.
